I'm reaching out because my research mentor Cameron and I are working on filming an instructional video on point of care ultrasound for detection of deep vein thrombosis, and we were hoping to find some support with filming and finding standardized patients for the portions of the video showing how to obtain the ultrasound images. Would your team be available to help with this project, perhaps on October 25th? Thank you so much for your consideration.
